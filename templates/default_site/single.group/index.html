Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. You mean it controls your actions? I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. What!?

</p>

<p>I find your lack of faith disturbing. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. You mean it controls your actions? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricksand nonsense.</p>

<p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p>

<p>What!? You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>

<p>I'm trying not to, kid. You mean it controls your actions? What?! Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Red Five standing by.  Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. What?!</p>

<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Don't underestimate the Force. I call it luck. As you wish. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</p>

<p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦ Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
